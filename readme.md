# Magical Arena Project

## Overview
The **Magical Arena** project is a Java-based console application simulating a battle between two players. Each player has attributes: health, strength, and attack. Players take turns attacking and defending until one player's health reaches 0.

## Example Output
- Displays turn-by-turn attack and defense calculations.
- Shows player health updates.

Modify player attributes in `Main.java`:
```java
Player A = new Player( 50, 5, 10);
Player B = new Player(100, 10, 5);
```

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)
- IDE or Text Editor (Optional)

## Future Enhancements
- Adding special abilities for players.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI).
